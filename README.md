# CustomerDatabaseApp

Team 5 decided to create this Java program in NetBeans for a class project after our first program ran into several fatal errors.
This program connects to a local MySQL database and uses SQL queries to create, delete, or retrieve data from that database. This
program specifically orients its data in regards to customers for a small business of company. It stores data for each customer's
name, age, purchase, etc. This allows the company to to see who is buying their products, where their customers come from, the age
of their customers, what their customers are buying, and other relavent questions.

The progam currently has ten menu items and two different interfaces for these items. There is a console-driven menu-based interface and
a graphical user interface that the team created as an extra credit feature. All menu items work perfectly fine in both environments.

The program also has basic JUnit tests for all of its getter and setter methods. Our team did not create more complex JUnit tests as
we were more focused on getting the GUI to work properly.

We also wrote detailed JavaDoc comments for all the program's methods, or at least all of the ones that might have needed explaination. Here is a link to the JavaDocs webpage: <a href="https://team-5.github.io/CustomerDatabaseApp/">JavaDoc Comments</a>.
